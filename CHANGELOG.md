## [2.2.11] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed broadcast events not being received due to incorrect RabbitMQ queue bindings
  - `get_subscribed_routing_keys()` was being called before handlers were registered
  - Resulted in empty routing key list and queues with exact-match-only bindings
  - RPC calls worked, but broadcast events failed silently

### Added
- New `celery_app` parameter to `get_subscribed_routing_keys()` to force immediate handler registration
- New `force_import` parameter (default: `True`) to control import behavior
- Improved documentation and examples in function docstring

### Changed
- `get_subscribed_routing_keys()` now calls `celery_app.loader.import_default_modules()` if `celery_app` is provided
- This ensures handlers are registered before queue configuration

### Migration Required
- **BREAKING**: Services must pass `celery_app` parameter: `get_subscribed_routing_keys(celery_app=app)`
- **CRITICAL**: Delete old queues from RabbitMQ to remove incorrect persistent bindings
- See [MIGRATION_2.2.11.md](./MIGRATION_2.2.11.md) for detailed upgrade instructions

## [2.2.10] - 2025-10-28 (Unreleased)

### Changed
- Enhanced error messages for RPC calls with no handlers
- Improved logging to distinguish between RPC and broadcast event routing issues

## [2.2.9] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- Initial stable release with RPC and broadcast event support
- Topic exchange-based routing with Celery
- `@subscribe` decorator for handler registration
- `CeleryProducer` for publishing events and making RPC calls
- `create_topic_dispatcher` for event dispatching

### Changed
- Migrated from Pika-based implementation to Celery-only implementation
- Unified RPC and broadcast events under single topic exchange

## Upgrade Guide

### From 2.2.9 to 2.2.11

This is a **critical bug fix release**. All services using broadcast events should upgrade immediately.

**Quick upgrade:**
```bash
# 1. Update library
pip install tchu-tchu==2.2.11

# 2. Update celery.py
# FROM: all_routing_keys = get_subscribed_routing_keys()
# TO:   all_routing_keys = get_subscribed_routing_keys(celery_app=app)

# 3. Delete old RabbitMQ queues
rabbitmqctl delete_queue your_queue_name

# 4. Restart services
docker-compose restart your_service
```

See [MIGRATION_2.2.11.md](./MIGRATION_2.2.11.md) for complete instructions.
